Another book suggestion for you. "Who moved my cheese"

Hey Taniya, hope you're doing wonderful. I'm doing great like always. I have a book recommendation for you this week. It could help everyone. Idk if you ever heard of the book "The 5 love languages" by Gary Chapman, which talks about how every person has a different love language. Knowing the other person's language helps build and maintain happy relationships. It applies to kids, teenagers or your partner, as every person has a different personality. You'll see a whole lot of difference in your perspective. It changed mine. As an example(assuming you watched Breaking Bad), while most people hate Skyler White for cheating on Walter White, I don't. Because, keeping it short, Walter did not understand her love language. Neither did Skyler. It's a very small book btw, won't take long.
